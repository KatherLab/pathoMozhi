**Please read the following information carefully before proceeding.**

PathoMozhi is a **research prototype** adapted from the OpenFlamingo framework. It is designed to facilitate multimodal interaction with histopathological data, including whole-slide images (WSIs) and clinical language reports. The goal of this open-source project is to support research into AI-assisted pathology using pathology-specific foundation models and MIL-based training methods.

- [ ] I understand that PathoMozhi is a research prototype and I will only use it for non-commercial research purposes.

**Limitations.** PathoMozhi builds upon the OpenFlamingo architecture and leverages foundational models trained on diverse and partially unfiltered datasets. As such, it may produce unintended, inaccurate, or inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, the inclusion of multimodal inputs such as histological images introduces additional challenges in interpretation. Please exercise discretion in the use of model outputs and avoid sharing results without proper validation.

- [ ] I understand that PathoMozhi may produce unintended, inappropriate, offensive, and/or inaccurate results. I agree to take full responsibility for any use of the PathoMozhi outputs that I generate.

**Privacy and data collection.** This demo does NOT store any personal information or retain user inputs of any kind.

**Licensing.** This project builds on OpenFlamingo and inherits licensing constraints from its base model, including:
- The **LLaMA** large language model developed by Meta AI. Use of this model is subject to the LLaMA license agreement, as specified in the Meta request form.
- The **BioGPT** model developed by Microsoft Research. BioGPT is released under the MIT License and should be used in accordance with the terms specified in its original repository: https://github.com/microsoft/BioGPT
By using PathoMozhi, you agree to abide by both the LLaMA license agreement and the BioGPT license, along with any other licenses applicable to PathoMozhi-specific code and data.

- [ ] I have read and agree to the terms of the LLaMA and BioGPT license agreements and the additional PathoMozhi usage conditions.
